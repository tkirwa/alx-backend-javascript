- Location: `task_2`
- Description: Task 2 covers advanced TypeScript topics, including creating classes, using type predicates, and working with string literal types.

### Task 3
- Location: `task_3`
- Description: Task 3 introduces ambient namespaces and declaration merging in TypeScript. It also involves using third-party libraries with type declarations.

### Task 4
- Location: `task_4`

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the task directory you want to explore or work on (e.g., `task_0`, `task_1`, etc.).

3. Install project dependencies using npm:

   ```bash
   cd task_0  # Replace with the task directory of your choice
   npm install
   ```

4. Explore the TypeScript files in the task directory, and follow any specific instructions provided in the task's README.md (if available).

## Project Structure

The project is organized into task directories, with each task having its own set of TypeScript files and configuration. The typical structure of a task directory is as follows:

- `js`: Contains TypeScript code for the task.
- `package.json`: Configuration file for npm dependencies (specific to the task).
- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration file (specific to the task).
- `webpack.config.js`: Webpack configuration file (specific to the task).

Feel free to explore and experiment with each task's TypeScript code and configuration.
