## Introduction

ES6, also known as ECMAScript 2015, introduced a more structured and organized way to work with classes and prototypes in JavaScript. This project aims to provide a clear understanding of ES6 classes and related concepts, making it easier to write object-oriented JavaScript code.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Define a Class in JavaScript.
- Add methods to a class to perform various operations.
- Explain the purpose of and implement static methods in a class.
- Understand and use class inheritance to create subclasses.
- Explore metaprogramming in JavaScript using symbols.

## Requirements

- This project is designed to be executed on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using Node.js 12.11.x.
- Supported code editors include `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`, and Visual Studio Code.
- Ensure that all JavaScript files end with a new line.
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.
- Use the `.js` extension for your JavaScript code.
- Testing is done using Jest with the command `npm run test`.
- Code is verified against linting rules using ESLint with the command `npm run lint`.
- The code must pass all tests and linting checks. You can run both using `npm run full-test`.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, make sure you have Node.js 12.11.x installed on your Ubuntu 18.04 LTS system. You can install the necessary dependencies as follows:

```bash
npm install
```

## Class Definitions

This section covers how to define classes in JavaScript, including constructors, instance methods, and properties.

## Inheritance

Learn how to extend classes from one another, creating a hierarchy of classes with shared functionality.

## Static Methods

Explore the concept of static methods in classes and why they are useful for certain operations.

## Metaprogramming and Symbols

Discover metaprogramming in JavaScript using symbols, a powerful tool for creating unique object properties.

## Testing

Ensure that your code works as expected by running the provided tests using Jest:

```bash
npm test
```

## Linting

Check your code for code style and potential issues using ESLint:

```bash
npm run lint
```
